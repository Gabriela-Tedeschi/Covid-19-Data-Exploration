## Covid-19 Data Exploration (SQL)
Exploring a dataset from Our World in Data that tracks Covid-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations by country over time. This project uses joins, aggregate functions, user defined functions, subqueries, temp tables, and case statements. I used a project from the Youtube channel Alex The Analyst as a starting point.
